Drill 3: Background images
This drill will familiarize you with working with background images. Your starting point is two divs that have been styled into boxes: one with the class .animal, the other with the class .animals. As their names suggest, the challenge is to set background images of animals on each box.

For the .animal div, the background image should display once and take up the full width and height of the container.

For the .animals div, the background image should take up a quarter of the container, and repeat 4 times: it should have a 2-by-2 grid of the same animal image.

Both boxes are 400px wide by 400px tall. To practice controlling whether or not a background image repeats within an element, you'll need an image smaller than the container. While you're welcome to track down an image on your own, we suggest using lorempicsum to get a 200px by 200px image. To do that, you can use the link https://picsum.photos/200/200.

To complete this drill, you'll need to use the following CSS properties:

background-image
background-repeat
background-size
